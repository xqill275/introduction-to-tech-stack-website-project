# Project Overview

## Project Goals and Objectives
My main goals for this project were to create the Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Anything extra could be added onto the project once this crucial step was reached, and I was happy with it. The Most important pages to create first was the main home page, the job board and the user pages once these where done I then created a working login page and an more minor features to the other pages such as the testimonial loading with the home page

## Installation instructions
The only dependancy for this project is Node.js this is used for my backend, to install node.js please visit this page:
```
https://nodejs.org/en/download
```
Select the version for your operating system and follow the instructionts the installer show you, I do use the exspress package but as you will pull this repo down it is already installed and configured.
now that node.js is installed you now need to download this repo onto your system, you can do this by either 1. clicking the code button on the top right hand side then 2. clicking one of the download buttonts or you can git this down by:

```
git clone https://github.com/xqill275/introduction-to-tech-stack-website-project
```
now once you have a copy of my project onto your computer, to start the website:

1. enter the website folder:

for windows:
```
cd .\website\
```
for mac and linux:
```
cd /website
```
2. now you need to launch the app.js file with node.js to do this simply enter:
```
node .\app.js

3. now that you have launched this you should see the text:
```
Listening for requests on port 3000
